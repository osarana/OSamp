  American Psycho 2  by:

Bruno Ferreira

 My second skin about this great movie (I just feel there aren´t enough on this particular subject). It´s still a very simple and in my opinion tasteful skin, quite obviously made with the help of skinner programs (No, I´m not a professional designer and I don´t like to spend 8 or 10 hours in this sort of thing, altough I admire very much the ones who do).
